# Big Data Examples

This repository contains hands-on code and examples for understanding and practicing key Big Data technologies, including:

- **Hadoop MapReduce** (Java-based programs)
- **Hive** (Partitioning, Bucketing, Clustering)
- **Apache Spark** (RDDs, DataFrames, SQL)

The goal is to build a strong foundation in distributed computing by implementing classic problems such as Word Count, Sum, and Average using MapReduce, and optimizing queries using Hive and Spark.
